## Motivation
All software purpose is replace the human work by automation processes. Today, a software can sell (webshop), tracking data (ERP, CRM, Marketing tools), talk and aid (Cortana), find anything (Google), but they have to be controlled by users. If a program could think like a human then it could take the control over automated software. Like Cortana does with applications. If it was bigger and more complex then the software industry would achieve its goal. Nexus Engine is a good experiment and small step on this long way.
