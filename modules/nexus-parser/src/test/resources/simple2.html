			<p>The paint-and-sip industry is a little more than a decade old.
				People show up to drink while an instructor slowly guides them,
				step-by-step, through the creation of a prechosen design. The idea
				was pioneered by Painting With a Twist, which two women in New
				Orleans started while looking for a reason to gather after Hurricane
				Katrina; it now has 200-plus locations, more than a third of which
				opened last year. Based on growth, it was rated the No. 1 franchise
				in Entrepreneur magazine’s Franchise 500 list.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
			<p>A typical Paint Nite teacher is a young, full-time artist or
				an older art teacher. Many, like Boston’s Callie Hastings, who is
				now on staff at the company, once taught preschool. She says
				teaching 4-year-olds how to paint isn’t all that different from
				teaching drunk people: “They have short attention spans. So you have
				to talk in short sentences.” She was surprised to find that people
				didn’t choose classes based on date or location, but on the painting
				itself. They will drive an extra 45 minutes, past two other Paint
				Nite locations, to execute the pastoral landscape that will go
				perfectly in their dining room. To avoid copyright issues, all the
				paintings have been created by Paint Nite artists, and there’s a
				huge selection. One of Paint Nite’s first crises came when artists
				got mad that other people were using their works in classes. Now
				instructors give $10 per session to the creator of the work.</p>
			<p>Choosing the painting that brings in a crowd is an art in
				itself: The work can’t look so challenging that you’d have trouble
				reproducing it drunk; it should involve nature and have enough
				contrast to look good on social media; and, if possible, it should
				knock off a famous impressionist. Most artists learn this the hard
				way, despite the advice in Paint Nite’s starter kit. “A lot of them
				pick paintings based on what they like,” McGrail says. “One artist,
				Raisin—that was his first and last name—had a giraffe coming out of
				an elephant penis. Not surprisingly, it didn’t sell that well.”
				After years of pushing artists to hire a nude male model—Hermann and
				McGrail wanted to call it Asstastic night—without anyone taking them
				up on it, they recently got an instructor to do it in Boston in
				June. Demand was so high they had to rent out a theater.</p>
