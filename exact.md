# Exact @todo

## Prio 1
Separate services from SystemUtil for future multi threading usage. SystemUtil should be global but services should be local on each thread.

Modules should be wrapped by *modules* folder.

Prodcution, test, mysql variables should be constants.

## Prio 2
Writing new tests for increase coverage back to ~80%.
Extending Javadoc

## Prio 3
Windows and OSX tests required on automation test level.
PostgreSQL and SQLite testing needed on application level (also extending travis.yml).
